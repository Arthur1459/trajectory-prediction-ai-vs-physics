This script trains a neural network to predict trajectories using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor.
- aero.py
This script simulates the trajectory using physics-based modeling.
- Data Analyser.py
This script processes video footage to extract trajectory data.
- Analyser.py
This script compares the performance of the physics and AI models.
