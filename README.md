### Abstract

This project is a one-year research in the context of CPGE TIPE between 2023 and 2024, comparing traditional physics-based models and modern AI techniques for predicting the trajectory of paper airplanes.

The project involves experimental data collection, analysis using computer vision tools, and the comparison of
the two approaches in terms of accuracy, generalization, and reliability. 

The goal is to determine when AI models might be viable or even more effective than classical physical models. The study concludes that AI models are
viable for specific cases where itâ€™s easy to collect lot of data while the physical model demands a deeper theoretical understanding but is more generalizable.
